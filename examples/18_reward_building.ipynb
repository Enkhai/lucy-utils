    "\t- could be enhanced by:\n",
    "\t\t- distance ball to goal: \n",
    "\t\t\t- alignment + near goal means higher probability of scoring while also securing\n",
    "\t\t\t- problem: opponent team could tackle the player and have the ball move toward team goal in a straight line very quickly\n",
    "\t\t\t- idea: use the ball distance difference between the two goals. This way alignment is scored higher near the center and lower near the goals.\n",
    "\t\t- velocity player to ball:\n",
    "\t\t\t- velocity + alignment could throw the ball directly into the goal\n",
    "\t\t\t- problem: moving forward with high velocity and having to move backward if ball not scored can take time and is costly\n",
    "- Ball to goal wall distance / y coord:\n",
    "\t- the higher the y axis value the more the team pushes the opponent team to defend\n",
    "- Distance ball to goal: \n",
    "\t- one of the two best possible rewards\n",
    "- Distance player to ball:\n",

    "\t- increases probability of scoring\n",
    "- Velocity player to ball:\n",
    "\t- mediocre as a reward BUT\n",
    "\t- idea: enhance by player to ball and ball to goal offensive vector alignment\n",
    "    - idea extended: include player to ball distance, players that are far away have a very low chance of scoring. Reward name idea: offensive potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reward:\n",
    "- Touch ball with acceleration (difference between current and previous ball linear velocity) toward goal (current ball linear velocity vector)\n",
    "- Save boost reward inversely weighted by the absolute value of the utility score:\n",
    "\t- the larger or smaller the utility, the more in demand would be to use boost\n",
    "- Event rewards:\n",
    "\t- Demolish and demolished\n",
